# 🏴‍☠️ Haskell Build-O-Matic™ 5000 🏴‍☠️  

**The cursed build system Haskell *deserves* but not the one it *needs* right now.**  

A *100% Cabal/Stack-free* experience for the **true masochists** of Haskell development.  

## ✨ Features  

- **`.matic` config files** (because YAML is for cowards)  
- **Gaslight HLS** into thinking your project is "normal"  
- **Watch mode** that scours your project for changes every 4 seconds (patience is a virtue you don’t have)  
- **Nuclear clean** (no survivors, no traces, only pain)  
- **Zero dependencies** (except `ghc`, `bash`, and your poor life choices)  

## 💀 Quick Start  

1. **Summon a new project:**  
   ```sh
   ./matic create
   ```  
   *It'll help you create a new project (and maybe a few runtime errors).*

2. **Build (and gaslight HLS):**  
   ```sh
   ./matic build my-project -gaslight
   ```  
   *Watch as your editor stops screaming (out of fear).*  

3. **Run your abomination:**  
   ```sh
   ./matic run my-project
   ```  
   *If it fails, restart your editor. Then your computer. Then your life.*  

4. **Enter the rebuild cycle:**
   ```sh
   ./matic watch my-project
   ```
   *Like a nervous twitch, but for your CPU.*
   
4. **Clean up the evidence:**  
   ```sh
   ./build.sh clean my-project
   ```  
   *Your project will wake up tomorrow with no memory of ever compiling.*  

## 🔥 Why?  

- **You loathe Cabal.**  
- **You hate Stack.**  
- **You love chaos.**  
- **You’re probably a danger to society.**  

## 🚨 Warning  

This tool:  
- **Will** corrupt your global GHC package db.  
- **Will** make HLS question its life choices.  
- **Will not** scale beyond ~20 files (that’s a *you* problem).
